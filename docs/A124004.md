# OEIS A124004
[A124004](https://oeis.org/A124004) is the interger sequence of numbers of possible [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) games at the end of the n-th ply.

The game starts with this position:

It has 4 legal sucessors, one for each red cross. Thus we know the sequence begins with A124004(n=0) = 1 and A124004(n=1) = 4. Playing every legal move and summing up their number of legal moves one arrives at the next integer in the sequence. This process can be continued to arrive at this table:

This project was used to contribute A124004(19-20) to OEIS and here is how it was achieved and how to reproduce.

The symmetry group of a Reversi board is [Dih4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihedral_group), the same as for a square. There is one additional symmetrie in Reversi. If the colors of the discs are swapped and the color of the player about to play, we arrive at an equivalent position. This symmetrie is used to transform each position so that black is always about to play.

The computation is done in 3 stages:
1. The possible Reversi games at the end of the d-th ply can be reduced using the symmetry from above to produce a reduced set of positions, unique under the symmetrie.
2. For all positions in the reduces set from step 1 it is determined how many possible Reversi games at the end of the (n-d)-th ply there are.
3. Taking into account how many times a unique position appears in the original positions the grand total can be computed.

For A124004(20) d=6 was used. The symmetry reduces the set from 8'200 positions to 1'773.

For A124004(21) d=7 was used. The symmetry reduces the set from 55'092 positions to 10'649.

The intermediate results from step 2 are stored in the main folder and can be verified with the code in this project with ```PerftCuda.exe -f perft20_ply6.pos -fd 20 -d 6 -t 1000 1101``` which verifies the positions 1000 to 1100. Additional info is provided with ```-h```. With ```-cuda``` cuda capable accelerators are used.
These results require a substantial amount of calculations. It took an Intel Core i9-9900K equipped with two nVidia GeForce GTX 1080 Ti's with SLI about 70 hours to calculate A124004(20) and about 1'000 hours for A124004(21).
A position from perft20_ply6.pos takes on average 143 s and one from perft21_ply7.pos 338 s.
